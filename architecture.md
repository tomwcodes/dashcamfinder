    └── main.js               # Client-side functionality for filtering, sorting, and display
```

## Frontend Architecture

The application follows a simple, component-based architecture without using a framework. It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on progressive enhancement and responsive design principles.

### Key Components

1. **Header Component**
   - Logo and site navigation
   - Responsive design with mobile adaptations

2. **Filter System**
    - Data source selection (radio buttons for Amazon.com/Amazon.co.uk)
   - Brand filter (dropdown)
   - Model filter (dropdown, dynamically updated based on brand selection)
   - Sort options (price, rating, date, popularity)

3. **Results Display**

4. **Footer Component**
   - Affiliate disclosure
   - Contact information
   - Copyright information

```

1. User interacts with filter controls
2. JavaScript event handlers process the selections
3. Filter logic is applied to the product data (currently stored in a JavaScript array)
4. Filtered results are displayed in the table
5. URL parameters are updated for shareable filtered views
6. Page title and meta description are dynamically updated for SEO

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
- Semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO
- Structured data using Schema.org for enhanced search engine understanding
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing
- Responsive meta tags for mobile optimization

### CSS Architecture
- CSS variables for theming and consistency
- Mobile-first responsive design with media queries
- Animation and transition system for UI interactions
- Consistent spacing using an 8px grid system
- Modern layout techniques with Flexbox

### JavaScript Functionality
- Event-driven architecture for user interactions
- DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates
- Client-side filtering and sorting
- URL parameter management for shareable states
- Dynamic SEO updates (title, meta description)

## Data Management

Currently, the application uses client-side data management:
- Product data is stored in a JavaScript array in main.js
- Filtering and sorting occur entirely on the client side
- No persistent storage or backend API integration

## SEO Implementation

- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Schema.org structured data for products and organization
- Dynamic meta tags based on selected filters
- Canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content
- Sitemap.xml and robots.txt for search engine guidance
- Descriptive anchor text and image alt attributes

## Performance Optimizations

- CSS animations and transitions for smooth user experience
- Efficient DOM manipulation to minimize reflows
- External resources loaded with appropriate attributes
- Font Awesome for vector icons that scale well
- Google Fonts with proper font-display settings

## Accessibility Considerations

- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper color contrast ratios
- ARIA attributes where appropriate
- Keyboard navigable interface
- Focus states for interactive elements

## Future Architecture Enhancements

### Short-term Improvements
- Implement real filtering functionality with API integration
- Add search functionality
- Implement product comparison feature
- Add more detailed feature filters
- Implement dark mode

### Long-term Architecture Evolution
- Move to a component-based framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- Implement server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- Add a backend API for dynamic data retrieval
- Implement user accounts and saved preferences
- Add content management system for editorial content
- Implement analytics and personalization features

## Technology Stack

### Current Implementation
- HTML5
- CSS3 with variables and animations
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Google Fonts (Inter, Montserrat)
- Font Awesome icons
- Schema.org structured data

### Potential Future Stack
- Frontend Framework: React/Vue.js
- State Management: Redux/Vuex
- API: REST or GraphQL
- Backend: Node.js/Express
- Database: MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- Hosting: AWS/Netlify/Vercel
- CDN: Cloudflare/Akamai

## Development Workflow

The project follows a task-based development approach:
1. Define specific tasks in the todolist.md file
2. Implement the required functionality
3. Mark tasks as completed
4. Update the memory.md file with the current state
5. Document any learnings or improvements to development guidelines

## Conclusion

DashCamFinder is built with a simple but effective architecture that prioritizes user experience, performance, and SEO. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements, with a clear path for evolution as the application grows in complexity and features.
