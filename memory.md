# newdashcamfinder Project

## Project Overview
DashCamFinder is a web application designed to help users compare dash cam prices and features across various brands and models. The application provides a user-friendly interface for filtering and sorting dash cams based on different criteria, with a focus on providing comprehensive product information to aid purchasing decisions.

## Current State
The project has a functional frontend implementation with the following features:
- Responsive design with CSS variables for consistent theming
- Product data stored in JavaScript array (12 dash cam products)
- Filtering system by marketplace, brand, model, resolution, price range, and rating
- Sorting options by popularity, price, rating, and release date
- Two view modes: table view and grid view
- URL parameter management for shareable filtered views
- Dynamic SEO updates (title, meta description)
